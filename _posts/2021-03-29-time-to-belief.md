One of my favorite books ever is [The Dip](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/324748.The_Dip) by Seth Godin. It's a tiny book with the simple message that everything worth doing has a "Dip" (or multiple dips) along the way, and to succeed, you have to overcome and power through the dip.

Setting up my website reminded me of the good times when I was building [shengji.io](https://shengji.io/lobby) this time last year. I felt the same mental strain of reading though Github Pages documentation, debating among different ways of hosting a website, copying and pasting error messages into Google, and the like.

However, the process was much shorter this time, and I realized that similar to the idea of the Dip, **every project or undertaking has a ballpark range of how long it takes before you start to see light at the end of the tunnel.**

Life before this point is pretty grim, and you're not sure if things will work out. After the inflection point, there's still a lot of work to be done, but success feels inevitable and it's only a matter of time before you get there. For lack of a better word, I'll call it **"time-to-belief."** Awful, but hopefully it gets the point across.

This got me thinking, what are some examples I've come across so far?
- Setting up this website - 2-3 hours
- Building shengji.io - ~1 month. Building the entire game took more than 2 months, and I was fixing bugs for another few weeks after that, but 1 month was how long it took for me to develop conviction that I would make it to the finish line.
- Starting a comapny - I haven't done this, so I'm only speculating here. I'd guess this is multiple orders of magnitude longer, and there are many dips. In fact, perhaps it's a non-ending stream of dips that vary in severity and nature. Sure, you can derisk yourself along the way -- for example, chances of dying are much lower for startups that make it to series A -- but you're never really out of the woods. It's a sobering thought.
