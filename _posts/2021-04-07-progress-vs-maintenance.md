I've heard both goals and processes recommended as the best way to get things done. For the longest time I didn't know which one to use, so I mixed them together, and it kind of worked.

### Goals vs. processes
On one hand, there are more traditional goal-setting tactics such as [OKRs](https://rework.withgoogle.com/guides/set-goals-with-okrs/steps/introduction/), [BHAGs](https://www.jimcollins.com/article_topics/articles/BHAG.html), and (gulp) New Year's resolutions.

I love the idea of OKRs and BHAGs. My old company used OKRs to great effect, and I still use them in my personal life.

On the other hand, people like James Clear recommend avoiding goals, and focusing on forming the right [systems and processes](https://jamesclear.com/goals-systems) that will naturally lead you to the outcome you want. This also made a lot of sense to me.

When I was working, I had a fixed schedule and life was more straightforward. My productivity stack worked well enough that I didn't have to think about it.

These days, as a grad student with competing priorities and longer timelines for my work, I realized my system wasn't good enough. I had turned some streams of work into processes and I was making steady progress, but it wasn't fast enough.

This got me thinking, *when should you set up a process versus a goal with a deadline?*

### Progress vs. maintenance
The answer is it depends whether the work falls within a prioritized area of your life. **In other words, is it an area of progress or an area of maintenance?**

As a grad student, making progress with research is one of my main priorities. I'm trying to become an expert in this space. Not surprisingly, it's a progress area. For progress areas, you should **set outcome-oriented goals with deadlines** - e.g. I will complete the next chunk of research by Friday, or I will not sleep on Friday night (thank you Malte for the inspiration).

On the other hand, when it comes to working out, I want to stay in shape but I'm not trying to be world-class. Maintenance is enough for me. For maintenance areas, it's better to **set up low-touch, low-friction, and automated processes**.

I want to work out consistently, but I don't want to dedicate extra willpower to thinking about it. If I have a poor workout or even skip a workout once or twice, it's not the end of the world. I just want to be good enough, and *the process is there as a safety net* so I don't fall off the rails and skip workouts for a month.

Another way to put it is that processes are useful as a lower bound and a way to minimize downside. Outcome-oriented goals are useful for hitting the upper bound and capturing upside.
