Hello! I'm a chemical engineering PhD student at Columbia University, researching long-duration energy storage. I also started Columbia Cleantech Ventures, a group of over 100 students interested in cleantech, where I host fireside chats with founders and VCs.

Before this, I worked at [Klaviyo](https://www.klaviyo.com/), a tech startup in Boston, as one of their first data scientists.

Prior to that that, I researched energy and natural gas policy at [Environmental Defense Fund](https://www.edf.org/).

For fun, I built [shengji.io](https://shengji.io/lobby), which has given me yet another way to procrastinate.

I'm working to accelerate clean energy, and looking for the next thing worth plowing through the Dip. If you're interested in similar things, I'd love to chat.
