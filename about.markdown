Hello! I'm a chemical engineering PhD student at Columbia University, researching long-duration batteries.
I previously worked at Klaviyo, a tech startup in Boston, as one of the first data scientists during their series A through C.
I'm working to accelerate clean energy and looking for the next thing worth plowing through the Dip. If you're interested in similar things, I'd love to chat.
